# FdF

Welcome to our version of the 42 project: **FDF**.

**FDF** is a wireframe rendering program, taking as an input a file containing coordinates (the position of the number being its x/y coordinates, and z its height value).

1. To run our program, git clone our repository like so:

#### $git clone "https://github.com/AntoineFonck/FdF.git"

2. cd into this newly created directory:

#### $cd FdF

3. and simply run in your terminal: 

#### $make && make clean

4. The fdf executable should now have been created. Now you can launch the program using:

#### $./fdf **[valid input file]**
*Remember that a valid input file holds only numbers, corresponding to the coordinates of the points you wish to represent in 3D*

# Have fun ! :)
